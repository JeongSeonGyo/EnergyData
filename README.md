# EnergyData_jhyun

This is a series of process showing the effort to manage energy more efficiently through analyzing data from certatin buildings.

  * **Preprcessing**
    * Interpolation
    * Normalization
    * Vectorization
  
  * **Clustering** - unsing unsupervised learning algorithm  
      (_yet clusters are not verified_)
    * K-means
    * Affinity propagation
    * Baysesian network
    
  * **Abnormal detection**
    * Detect faults in the building system
    

### Getting started

* Prerequisites

* Running the codes
  * Preprocessing   
    ```
    $ python DATA2VEC.py <directory_path>
    ```
  * Clustering   
    ```
    $ python VEC2CLUSTER.py <bin_file_path>
    ```
  * Abnormal detection   
    ```
    $ python ...
    ```
